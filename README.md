Company Reviews: Incorporated a review system where users can submit and view reviews for companies. This feature empowers job seekers with valuable insights about potential employers.

MongoDB Integration: Integrated MongoDB as the database to efficiently store and retrieve job data and company reviews.

Technology:

Node.js: Utilized Node.js as the backend runtime environment for building the server-side logic and handling data processing.

Express.js: Employed the Express.js framework to create a robust and scalable server application.

EJS Templating Engine: Implemented EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine to render dynamic HTML templates with the retrieved data.

MongoDB: Leveraged MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store job postings and company reviews in a flexible and scalable manner.

HTML & CSS: Used HTML to structure the application's content and CSS for styling, creating an appealing and user-friendly interface.

The Job Board Web Application provides a centralized platform for job seekers to explore job opportunities conveniently. Its user-friendly design and seamless functionality make job searching and application processes efficient and enjoyable. Additionally, the integration of company reviews empowers users with valuable information to make informed decisions about potential employers.
